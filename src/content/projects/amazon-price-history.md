## Introduction
I’ve been a shortcuts warrior ever since I discovered it’s usage for changing app icons in iOS 14!!(that was a while ago we are on 18 now)

I like to make a shortcut for any little thing that might require a repetitive task and the shortcuts app is like a for loop in your pocket. 

I’ve made shortcuts for automating my summer jobs, making decisions, and even for making my own janky Spotify Lock Screen complication. Out of all of these, the one that gets the most use( when I have internship money ) is my Amazon price history shortcut. I’ve essentially made a quick way to access the [camelcamelcamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com) price chart for an Amazon page on mobile. I’m sure there’s some sort of app that you can use that already has this but the nice thing about the shortcut is it works with the official app.

## Shortcuts quick intro

If you haven’t been introduced to the shortcuts app, it’s a built in app that comes with your iPhone, iPad and Mac! It’s a fun tool and quite powerful and feature rich for something Apple does not expect most users to utilize. They’ve added a lot of scripting tools and you can even run ssh commands through it! 

The app is mostly known for letting you customize app icons but there’s so many ways you can use it, I’ve even used it to schedule texts before the `send later` feature was added on iOS 18. Check the links at the bottom of this post to see some resources and a link to my Price History one!

## The idea
It really came to fruition from my laziness when shopping. I’m a frequent visitor of [r/bapcsalescanada](https://reddit.com/r/bapcsalescanada) and I was tired of going to a separate website to check the price history for one of the Amazon posts. Desktop users have a handy extension that pulls up the price data easily but I didn’t have anything like that for mobile. Usually when something like that happens, I hit up the trusty shortcuts app. Here’s a screenshot:
